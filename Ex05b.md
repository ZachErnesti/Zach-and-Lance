**Feedback**

**1.** The E-R Diagram is nicely designed, displaying relations and their attributes effectively, as well as clearly showing modalities and cardinalities. They have also clearly labled their primary and foreign keys. The diagram is also organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the relationships.

**2.** I do not fully understand the purpose of the Outsourced relation, unless Avolve Fitness plans to hire outside personnel or agencies to work for them temporarily. If they are, the attributes found in the relation may not be enough to be beneficial. This relation may need to be expanded otherwise it does not share much meaninful data beyond the name of the company.

**3.** I do not see a relation that tracks membership sign ins when customers visit the gym. I think that it would be beneficial to utilize such a relation because the data could be useful in determining scheduling as well as capacity.

**4.** I do not see a relation that contains each customers membership plan. That is crucial infromation from a financial perspective as well as tracking when membership payments are do for each customer.
